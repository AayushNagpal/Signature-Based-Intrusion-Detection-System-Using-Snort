# Signature-Based-Intrusion-Detection-System-Using-Snort
The majority of IDSs use a set of signatures that define what suspicious traffic is, and SNORT is one popular and actively developing open-source IDS that uses such a set of signatures known as SNORT rules. Aim of this project is to identify a way in which IDS could be developed by generalizing rules to identify novel attacks and displaying reports and alerts using appropriate plugins.
Objective of this Research is to:
1)	Setting up the working IDS with default rules
2)	Modify  Snort.Conf file
3)	Designing new rules for better detection.
4)	Using plugins to modify input and output of snort detection
5)	Using MySQL plugin to log data into database
6)	Using Analysis Control for Intrusion Detection (ACID) tool to process and present Reports.
7)	Displaying data using appropriate interface
